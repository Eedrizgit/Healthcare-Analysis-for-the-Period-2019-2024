**Comprehensive Evaluation of Healthcare (2019–2024)**

This analysis primarily aims to assess healthcare trends from 2019 to 2024, with a focus on evaluating individual health status, identifying potential risks, and delivering personalized health recommendations. 

To identify health risks and improve overall performance, the establishment adopts a data-driven strategy to design targeted programs that address rising medical conditions across different age groups, blood types, and other key factors. This analysis aims to uncover potential causes of these conditions and explore effective methods to reduce their occurrence. It also investigates trends and patterns in patient admissions to support more informed healthcare planning.

In-Analysis observations

1. Arthritis emerged as the most prevalent medical condition from 2019 to 2024, with a total of 9,308 cases.
2. Asthma, on the other hand, recorded the fewest cases, amounting to 9,105.
3. Cigna was the leading insurance provider, covering the highest total bill of $287,139,345.27 during the period from 2019 to 2024.
4. The funds allocated for diabetes treatment were the highest, totaling $238,539,725.49, while cancer treatment funds were the lowest, at $232,167,861.31.
5. In 2020, there were 11,285 cases recorded, marking the highest number during the period from 2019 to 2024.
6. Individuals with blood group A- had the highest incidence of medical conditions.

In analysis recommendations

1. I suggest the implementation of a dedicated health program focusing on arthritis awareness. The aim should be to educate people on its causes, with a particular emphasis on prevention and managing arthritis in its early stages. This proactive approach could significantly minimize the number of cases.
2. Cigna, being the leading insurance provider, stands as a trusted and reliable option. People can confidently place their health insurance funds with them, knowing they’ll act when the need arises.
3. A comprehensive program could also help reduce the funds people need to save for healthcare. By raising awareness about lifestyle changes to prevent conditions like diabetes, such as reducing alcohol intake — one of its key contributors — we can tackle the problem at its root.
4. Individuals with blood group A- and those facing high-risk health issues should be encouraged to regularly strengthen their immune systems. This simple yet effective measure could help prevent or manage many common medical conditions.

   Recommendation
(Insights from 2019–2024)

1. Based on the analysis, individuals with the A- blood group appear more prone to hypertension than cancer. Their immune system seems more capable of combating cancerous cells. However, they should avoid cholesterol-rich foods, as poor dietary habits may significantly increase their risk of hypertension. It’s important to educate them on lifestyle choices that could jeopardize their health.

2. While A+ individuals are also likely to develop hypertension, they seem less vulnerable to conditions like arthritis. They should be made aware of the importance of healthy living, particularly by steering clear of foods and habits that might trigger high blood pressure.

3. The data further suggests that those with an AB- blood group should be more cautious about cancer, while AB+ individuals should focus on managing their risk of hypertension. A combination of physical and digital health awareness campaigns is likely to reduce the incidence of these conditions.

4. Interestingly, hospital admissions for people with the B- blood group have declined since 2022, and for those with B+, the drop began in 2020. Most individuals with B- tend to be overweight, while only a smaller portion suffer from asthma. Proactively managing weight from an early age could help prevent obesity-related complications.

5. Meanwhile, those with the B+ blood group are more affected by arthritis than hypertension. Because they may be more susceptible to joint-related issues, they are advised to avoid cold environments and protect themselves from injuries that could aggravate arthritis.

6. From the analysis, it is recommended that individuals with the O- blood group monitor their weight closely, as they are at a higher risk of obesity. Those with O+ are more likely to suffer from arthritis, and should therefore avoid cold conditions or other arthritis triggers.

7. With the drastic decline in medical conditions observed by 2024, it’s crucial to sustain the efforts that led to this improvement. Regular community awareness on all health conditions should continue, including:

a. What to avoid in daily routines

b. Simple exercises that help prevent disease

c. Healthy eating habits that reduce obesity risk

d. Personalized healthcare approaches for preventing diabetes

e. Lastly, individuals living with asthma should be educated on how to manage attacks effectively, to reduce the chances of hospitalization after each episode.
